The language I  have made this algorithm is C# and editor Visual Studio. It is a windows console application.

The exercise for the problem:
Given a vector of positive and negative integers, write a program that finds the
continous sequence with maximal sum and prints out start index, end index and
the sum.
Example:
For vector 12, -34, 40, 6, -10, 56, 12, -1, -15, 10, 4 start index is 2, end index 6 and the
sum 104.

The vector given for test in app is the vector below.
